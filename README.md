# Interrupt Controller using Verilog
A project to implement and test interrupt controller using Questasim software.
- Design made using Verilog and Testbench made in 2 versions: System Verilog and Verilog.
- Supports programming priorities for each device using Advanced Peripheral Bus(APB) protocol by master.
- Developed testbench with various test cases to verify controller working when programmed for different priorities.
